	<p>"Harry Styles ushered in the start of his "Fine Line" era on album release day by performing a one night only, sold-out show in Los Angeles. The former One Direction member drew thousands of people to The Forum to hear his album sung in its entirety live for the first time on the same day it was released." </p>
	<h3> Louis Tomlinson </h3>

	<br>
	<p>"Walls, Tomlinson's debut album, debuted at number 9 on the US Billboard 200 with 39,000 album-equivalent units, making it the first new album for Arista Records in almost nine years to hit the top 10 on the chart. At release, the album sold 35,000 units.[33][6] The album also charted in several countries and reached number one in Mexico, Scotland and Portugal."</p>
	<h3> All Time Low </h3>

	<p>"All Time Low is on the radio now. Some fans have mixed feelings about this, considering that historically, it's been a pop punk band that teens could turn to as an alternative to mainstream hits. These people needn't fear, though, because All Time Low's recent show at Rams Head Live! was still very much a rock show. Full of roaring guitars, unfiltered banter, and electric energy, all four bands brought the perfect summer storm to cloudy Baltimore."</p>
	<h3> Twenty One Pilots </h3>

	<h3> Coldplay </h3>

	<br>
	<p>"The evening was electric from the start as Coldplay worked a near flawless two-hour-plus 23 song set with each beat and note perfectly accentuated. Props to the sound engineer or perhaps itâ€™s the chosen sound system but Martin's vocals along with Jonny Buckland's guitar work, Guy Berryman's bass and Will Champion's drums all popped without dueling over one another. Even Martin's occasional acoustic guitar rose from the flood of sounds to add its bit of flavor to the music."</p>
	<h3> Niall Horan </h3>

	<h3> Maggie Rogers </h3>

	<br>
	<p>From the moment Rogers dove into opener "Give A Little" one thing was entirely clear: She's a big deal. Since she started promoting her first full-length Heard It In A Past Life, which dropped at the top of the year, her trajectory to the top has been expedited. She had a breakout moment on Saturday Night Live last November when she performed barefoot and in a vibrant red floor-length dress, opened Madison Square Garden for Mumford & Sons and earned her first No. 1 on Adult Alternative Songs with the rallying "Light On.""</p>
	<h3> The 1975 </h3>
